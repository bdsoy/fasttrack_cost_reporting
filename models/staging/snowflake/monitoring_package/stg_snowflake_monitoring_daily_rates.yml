    description: |-
      wrapper model around the view `daily_rates` from the dbt_snowflake_monitoring pkg;

      A copy of snowflake.organization_usage.rate_sheet_daily for the current Snowflake account, w/
      missing dates inputed. This model accounts for the fact that multiple rates will appear on a
      given day when the account is in overage. This happens for on-demand accounts, or fixed
      contract accounts who have exceeded their remaining balance.

      When the account is in overage, the usage_type will appear as 'compute' (instead of
      'overage-compute'), but the effective_rate will be the one associated with `overage-compute`.
      These instances can be identified using `is_overage_rate` to help understand why a rate may
      have suddenly changed.
